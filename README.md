# on-the-fly_processing

Designed for operation during single particle cryo-EM data collection on HMS Polara and F20 microscopes, these scripts are easily ported to work on any setup by modifying microscope specifications and programs called in 'proc_loop.sh'. 

General dependencies for these scripts are: 
  (i) bash version 4+
  (ii) python v.3
  (iii) MotionCor2 installed and in $PATH as 'MotionCor2'
  (iv) CTFFIND4 installed and in $PATH as 'ctffind' 

Together, these scripts enable easy file copying, micrograph image processing, and viewing on-the-fly:

(1) <b>copy_loop.sh </b> = Continuously copy new files using 'cp' or 'rsync' to a destination directory. Rsync supports copying over ssh protocol to remote workstations. The current implementation copies entire sub-directories and does not check for a minimum image size prior to copying. 

(2) <b>proc_loop.sh</b> = Continuously find new files of a specified name (e.g. Micrograph_name_####.tif) and process them for motion correction and CTF estimation. Results are stored in a 'on-the-fly_processing' sub-directory from the current working directory and key data are printed into terminal output and into a 'on-the-fly_data.log' file.

(3) <b>on-the-fly_logviewer.py</b> = Reads from a given 'on-the-fly_data.log' file to retrieve .GIF images of the corrected micrograph and its corresponding FFT/CTF fit for visual inspection. Once a log file is loaded images can be sequentially viewed using the <b>\<left></b> and <b>\<right></b> arrow keys or manually viewed by typing any number into the bottom right widget. The current loaded image can be marked for deletion by using the <b>\<d></b> hotkey and the list of marked images (as #### values) printed out into a 'bad_mics.txt' file with <b>\<Ctrl></b> + <b>\<s></b> or using the drop down menus. 

(4) <b>mark_listed_files.sh</b> = Read an input .txt file with a list of numbers per line (e.g. ####, of the form 'bad_mics.txt' output by on-the-fly_logviewer.py) and mark any files of a given prefix (e.g. Micrograph_name_####.tif) with a given suffix for easy downstream handling (e.g. batch deletion via: <i>rm *\<suffix></i>). 

(5) <b>GIF_particle_boxer_v1.py</b> = Run this in a directory of .GIF image files derived from an EM dataset to view .GIF files sequentially. Files can be marked and marked files written to a file for later use on the commandline (e.g. copy marked images, delete marked images ...) . This program supports manually picking coordinates (note: there will be some inaccuraccy if the .GIF image is highly compressed), and unpicking coordinates using EMAN2 .BOX format files. Particle coordinate operations require proper input of .MRC image file dimensions.

        Left click = Pick / unpick coordinates

        Middle click = Hide image markup to view image below 

        Right click = Erase using a brush (green square), hold and drag to erase many coordinates at once
        Mouse scroll = Increase / decrease brush size 
        'd' = Mark current image (marked images are highlighted with a red border
        Ctrl + S = Save marked image list into a file: 'marked_imgs.txt'
